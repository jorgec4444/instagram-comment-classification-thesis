sterling7,Graham Potter: 6/21 points. Chelsea have more backward passes than any other EPL team. This team can't create chances or even pick up good forward passes. Raheem Sterling can't face forward and take on fullbacks. #This team needs an overhaul from the manager because it's obvious that he is clueless. @chelseafc @sterling7 @jorginhofrello @masonmount @skysports @goalglobal @johnterry.26 @didierdrogba,instagram

In truth, it’s shameful.To assist you, here’s a brief programme guide to recent events off the pitch.Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was beaten to death in police custody in Tehran in September after her arrest for allegedly breaking rules on mandatory head-coverings. In the ensuing nationwide protests – which are continuing – Iran’s security forces have killed hundreds of people and detained nearly 10,000.

For Iranians, soccer is about team work and supporting the people of Iran. Unfortunately, Iran’s soccer team decided to forget the chivalrous spirit and turned their back onto the people of Iran. As you know, Islamic Regime in Iran has been killing many innocent people including more than 60 children. I want to ask you as a good sportsman to be the voice of  the people in Iran and raise awareness towards every day brutal killings in Iran by Islamic Regime.

sterling7,"Some governments, such as Syria and Myanmar, kill their own people. Some, such as Russia, kill people in other countries, as in Ukraine.

In truth, it’s shameful.To assist you, here’s a brief programme guide to recent events off the pitch.Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was beaten to death in police custody in Tehran in September after her arrest for allegedly breaking rules on mandatory head-coverings. In the ensuing nationwide protests – which are continuing – Iran’s security forces have killed hundreds of people and detained nearly 10,000.

sterling7,"Some governments, such as Syria and Myanmar, kill their own people. Some, such as Russia, kill people in other countries, as in Ukraine. Iran’s government is doing both, home and away.Now, Iran’s national football team is about to play in the 2022 World Cup – as if nothing untoward were happening. This is not OK. In truth, it’s shameful.To assist you, here’s a brief programme guide to recent events off the pitch.Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was beaten to death in police custody in Tehran in September after her arrest for allegedly breaking rules on mandatory head-coverings. In the ensuing nationwide protests – which are continuing – Iran’s security forces have killed hundreds of people and detained nearly 10,000. Demands for reform have been rejected out of hand.Please show a gesture of solidarity with the people of Iran who are fighting for their freedom against the Islamic Republic.Please be the voice of all Iranian innocent children who were killed for freedom!#mahsaamini",instagram

sterling7,"Dear beloved English football team, soon you will be competing on the world stage and fans across the globe will be watching. On Nov 21st, as you step on the pitch to play your counterparts, we ask you to show a gesture of solidarity with the people of Iran who are fighting for their freedom against the Islamic Republic. A regime that is by no means a representative of innocent Iranians. A regime that oppresses and bans women from football stadiums. A regime that killed the young #MahsaAmini and continues to persecute anyone who stands in its way, including minorities, children and students A regime that stands by Putin's side as he unleashes brutality against innocent Ukrainians.You are role models for millions of children around the world. Like all the great athletes that came before you, this is your opportunity to make history both on and off the pitch. It is an opportunity to show millions of innocent children that the world has not abandoned them. It is the gift of hope for a better tomorrow. The world will be watching. Please be the voice of innocent Iranians. #mahsaaminiمهسا_امینی",instagram

sterling7,"World cup is coming, but we do not look forward to it.There are strikes and demonstrations all over my country Iran.Many sportsmen including Ali Daei, the legendary Iranian football champion showed their support and sympathy.Many Iranians are and have been arrested, including Parviz Broumand who attended in world cup 1998 as reserve goalkeeper. Also Ali Karimi former Iranian football player who participated in world cup 2006 was abounded from coming back to Iran after showing his support for the protesters. Javad Nekounam former Iranian national team captain, refused to join the national team as coach in 2022 world cup games. And Mehdi Mahdavi Kia head coach of Iranian youth national team did not accept Fifa formal invitation to participate at the opening ceremony of the event.People, including children and women are now being arrested, tortured, raped and killed in Iran. the World cup games draw so much attention, exactly what the Iran regime wants.When the legendary Michael Jackson suspiciously died, there were demonstrations all over Iran, But the incident drew the international attention, so the Iran regime could easily stop the demonstrations at the time.Each time an Iranian team or athlete has had to compete with an opponent from Israel, the Islamic republic Regime has avoided it by any means possible, considering that by participating in such match, they have recognized israel as a country, which they don't.  By using their own weapon against them ( which is refusing to match with a country that it's government does not represent it's own nation), you can draw some of that attention back to the events inside of Iran.Taking such action may have consequences, We know. but remember, people in Iran are losing their lives, what you may lose is a cup, but you gain the respect of the world. Your players may go inside and start the game. But stand still! In favour of my people.",instagram

For Iranians, soccer is about team work and supporting the people of Iran. Unfortunately, Iran’s soccer team decided to forget the chivalrous spirit and turned their back onto the people of Iran.

sterling7,"Dear beloved English football team, soon you will be competing on the world stage and fans across the globe will be watching. On Nov 21st, as you step on the pitch to play your counterparts, we ask you to show a gesture of solidarity with the people of Iran who are fighting for their freedom against the Islamic Republic. A regime that is by no means a representative of innocent Iranians. A regime that oppresses and bans women from football stadiums. A regime that killed the young #MahsaAmini and continues to persecute anyone who stands in its way, including minorities, children and students. A regime that stands by Putin's side as he unleashes brutality against innocent Ukrainians. You are role models for millions of children around the world. Like all the great athletes that came before you, this is your opportunity to make history both on and off the pitch. It is an opportunity to show millions of innocent children that the world has not abandoned them. It is the gift of hope for a better tomorrow. The world will be watching. Please be the voice of innocent Iranians",instagram

sterling7,"A small gesture after scoring a goal would make a huge impact on us Iranian who are getting shot dead in the streets right now, IR players decided to make a deal behind the close doors for their financial gain and silence the voice of Iranians, please please when you score a goal hold your hair up and snip as a sign of cutting your hairs with a scissor. You have no obligation for doing this but you can be our voice when we don’t have one. Thanks #MahsaAmini #مهسا_امینی",instagram
sterling7,Hi Im from Iran. As you know there is a pr*testing happening in Iran for human right and women. Our football team didnt support us at all when we needed that. They all stayed silent. So their game means nothing to us and we cant hope for their success.  All of us are praying for England  team to win🙏🏻 We wish luck for all your team. But can we ask for a favor?  Can you support us and do some symbol in the middle of your game with Iran as standing with Iranian women? Just anything.. we would appreciate that. But anyway we hope that you win,instagram
sterling7,The players of the Islamic Republic of Iran team are not the national team of IranPlease be the voice of the people of Iran and their revolution🤍🕊#mahsaamini#iran_revolution,instagram
sterling7,"PLEASE BE OUR VOICES . In the last 62 days, the Islamic regime has killed 402 of our compatriots who have protested for their rights  to gain their freedom and basic rights, under unequal conditions. This cruel and repressive regime  has not even had mercy for children and teenagers and has killed 58 innocent children and buried them under strict security measures and is trying to cut off the voices of protesters and communication channels with human rights organizations.

sterling7,"Ten years ago on this very day, I made my debut for @england; something I’d dreamed about since I was a boy staring up at those Wembley arches from my back garden. Every muddy Sunday League match and gruelling training exercise led me to that moment, where I could stand up and proudly represent the Three Lions. Now here I am, ten years later, wearing number 10, heading into my third World Cup with the next generation of legends, and now it’s me holding the most caps...🤯 reality really can be crazier than dreams. The thing that stands out the most is our twelfth man: the fans. By our side with the energy and voice to lift us through every moment and power us up for every duel.

In my country, the basic human rights are violated by the government, religious minorities have no place, and women are considered a second-class sex and must obey the imposed and forced hijab.  The Iranian football team is a government team and the national team of our country is not Iran.  During the past two months, the government of Iran has killed many young people and children of our country during peaceful protests, and thousands of people are in the custody of the regime.

sterling7,@sterling7 you guys played like a child this days. Look at Arsenal match today Sunday.  It shows that you people is not fighting for tittle because if it's today will  game against Arsenal would've proved it all. Look at your fellow boy Gabriel Jesus Look how is good dribbling scoring goals look sharp smart he doesn't think twice before playing the ball always faster. I'm afraid I don't think you guys will make it Top Four tables this season because you guys aren't serious of even wining any tittle this season.  Arsenal prove they are the champions of EPL this season. SHAME,instagram

On Nov 21st, as you step on the pitch to play your counterparts, we ask you to show a gesture of solidarity with the people of Iran who are fighting for their freedom against the Islamic Republic.  A regime that is by no means a representative of innocent Iranians.  A regime that oppresses and bans women from football stadiums.  A regime that killed the young #MahsaAmini and continues to persecute anyone who stands in its way, including minorities, children and students.  A regime that stands by Putin's side as he unleashes brutality against innocent. Ukrainians You are role models for millions of children around the world.  Like all the great athletes that came before you, this is your opportunity to make history both on and off the pitch.  It is an opportunity to show millions of innocent children that the world has not abandoned them.  It is the gift of hope for a better tomorrow.  The world will be watching.

sterling7,"Hello 👋🏻 ‎‏i don’t know if you’ve heard but Iran has been witnessing unprecedented nation-wide protests which the women are stepping on the streets and showing their bravery, dignity, and wrath against the sexist Islamic regime and its humiliating rules against women which caused the hashtag “#MahsaAmini” to be tweeted over 130 million times in less than 10 days! Mahsa was a 22yo innocent girl brutally killed by the Islamic regime in Iran. The regime, then, cut off the Internet and killed hundreds of others including Nika (16), Sarina (17), and Hananeh (23).People are shouting “the regime must go”PLEASE PLEASE BE OUR VOICE🤍 Iranian women and men seriously need your support🕊#iranrevolution #mahsaamini #nikashakarami #sarinaesmailzadeh #freedom",instagram

I gently touched each shoulder, with Phillip by my side. Then I turned away and walked, with My Angel guide. Phillip held my hand, as he lead the way, to a world where King's and Queens, are Monarch's every day. I was  given a crown to wearor a Halo known by some. The difference is up here, they are worn by everyone. I felt a sense of peace, my reign had seen its end. 70 years I had served my Country, as the peoples friend.

sterling7,"It clearly shows the players that caused the problems for TT. As Sterling, who has barely been at the club for a month has posted, but quite a few others haven't. Respect, Raheem🙌🏻💙",instagram
sterling7,"He’s the best manager in the world there will never be another manager like him, I was gutted that he was sacked and put ‘Harry Potter’ in his place. The new owners should be ashamed of how they orchestrated this unforgivable act of sacking our TT who will always be a legend for me as i am a true Chelsea supporter supporter. They lied to all the fans and the new signings, for me it’s a betrayal to Thomas Touchel and all the fans. Im still in mourning. I wish you all the best Raheem. The way I feel I cannot back the new manager.",instagram

sterling7,Dude they all loved Tuchel🤦🏻‍♂️,instagram
sterling7,deserved more time with him :(,instagram
sterling7,😢,instagram
sterling7,You sacked him with your abysmal performances.  No serious coach would keep you 90 minutes with such performances and poor final decisions. I hope another keep would pull a Guardiola stunt on you.,instagram
sterling7,bro you knew him for like 2 months 💀💀💀,instagram
sterling7,"You were there for a week, chill out",instagram
sterling7,kinda funny how players are posting their love for tuchel as a message of “it wasn’t me” “don’t blame me” to the fans LMAO,instagram
sterling7,"You knew the guy for 2 months, bro that was an internship",instagram
